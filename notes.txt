How will the game work?

We'll have an ogre or something to defeat.
His health will be according to his level.
his level will be according to the game level.
You will have a timer to defeat him, or a HP bar of your own and he'll attack you.

You have 4 crystals of varying abilities.
8 colors available.
all just do a set amount of damage...
maybe add crazy shit later.

colors = [
red:
blue:
yellow:
green:
purple:
orange:
white:
black:
]

damagevalues = [1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34];

I want to be able to create new crystals that have a random color and a random damagevalue
